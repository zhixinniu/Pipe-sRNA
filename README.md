# Pipe-sRNA

This repo is the pipeline for small RNA-seq (sRNA-seq) analysis. The codes and workflow are mostly derived from nf-core/smrna-seq pipeline. But in some cases, someone could failed to install and run nf-core/smrna-seq locally. Here, I provide a more flexible way for people who want to customize and optimize their analysis workflow, or want to perform analysis step-by-step.\
